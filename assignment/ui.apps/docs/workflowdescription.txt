Workflow Model: CSV Page Creation Process

Description:
This workflow model is designed to create pages in AEM based on data provided in a CSV file. The model includes a process step that utilizes the `PageCreationProcess` class to read the CSV file, extract the necessary details (title, path, description, tags, thumbnail), and create pages at the specified locations.

Process Step:
- PageCreationProcess: A custom workflow process that reads the CSV file and creates pages in AEM based on the data provided.

Launcher Configuration:
This workflow is automatically triggered using a workflow launcher. The launcher monitors the following path for CSV file uploads:

- Monitored Path: /content/dam/assignment

Trigger Condition:
- The workflow is triggered immediately when a CSV file is uploaded to the `/content/dam/assignment` directory in the AEM DAM.

Workflow Execution:
- When the CSV file is uploaded, the workflow launcher automatically initiates the `CSV Page Creation Process` workflow model.
- The workflow reads the CSV file and processes each row to create pages at the specified paths with the provided metadata.

Outcome:
- The pages are created according to the details specified in the CSV file, with all metadata (title, description, tags, and thumbnail) applied to each page as defined in the process.
